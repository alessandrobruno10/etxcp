Code Snippets to handle colour spaces and simulate CVD (Colour Vision Deficiency)

ETxCP repo hosts some Python code snippets that help you deal with colour spaces, such as RGB, HSI, CIE L*a*b*, and CIE L*u*v*
Furthermore, a simulation of CVD (Colour Vision Deficiency) is handled using transformation matrices according to the scientific references listed below. 

It was run and tested on Google Colab.
